TODO

+ now
    - JEH doc UML
    - Repo.find() returns a list


+ priority 1
    - triggers should work like >= as remote sites might not report all states
    - SiteFileRef with timestamp (see TODO)
    - triggers as part of Site.Run, lwfm implements as current; "data trigger" is based on metadata - Event Message, Event Handler -
      trigger is a verb; add to doc UML
    - compute type in status message via job context


+ priority 2
    - JobStatus history
    - MetaRepo notate()
    - RunRepo
    - multi-Site Job status panel -> similar to DT4D's, but multi-Site
    - demo: lab device as a Site
    - local site driver subclass with ssh as run, scp as repo, with auth credentials


+ priority 3
    - digital thread graph render & navigate, incl. event trigger futures
    - full trigger model impl - fuzzy, timeouts, wildcards, persistence, etc. - triggers running other than locally
    - JSS security
    - adaptive job status polling based on emit & received job status timestamps
