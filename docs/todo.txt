TODO

+ now
    - test loggger in dt4d example
    - compute type in status message via job context (anything else to do?)
    - listComputeTypes returns complex list object w. metadata

lwfm: Repo.Run job status serialization incl. subclasses & job context

+ priority 1
    + event handlers
        - metadata-based filter implementation & example
        - better examples around multi-site - not all sites implement, but local does
        - triggers should work like >= as remote sites might not report all states
        - test: trigger job running on remote site, targer runs on remote site
    - SiteFileRef with timestamp (see TODO)
    - MetaRepo notate()


+ priority 2
    - JobStatus history
    - multi-Site Job status panel -> similar to DT4D's, but multi-Site
    - demo: lab device as a Site
    + event handlers
        - persisting over lwfm restart
        - full trigger model impl - fuzzy, timeouts, wildcards, persistence, etc.


+ priority 3
    - local site driver subclass with ssh as run, scp as repo, with auth credentials
    - digital thread graph render & navigate, incl. event trigger futures
    - RunRepo - robust impl
    - JSS security
    - adaptive job status polling based on emit & received job status timestamps
